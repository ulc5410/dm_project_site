	<div id="news5" class="w3-container w3-hide">
	  <p>
      The U.S. Supreme Court recently issued an important ruling on affirmative action, prohibiting colleges from considering an applicant's race in the admissions process. This ruling has significant implications for Asians, as Asian students have long faced various challenges and controversies in college admissions. Affirmative action, also known as affirmative action, is a policy that was first introduced in the 1960s to enhance diversity. However, the Supreme Court's ruling reversed decades of U.S. practice of affirmative action by declaring that the Constitution prohibits colleges from considering race. Although the Supreme Court did not directly claim that the ruling overturned a legal requirement that universities consider race in building a diverse student body, its impact could be significant. The ruling applies to all public and private universities in the United States, but has had the most dramatic impact on some prestigious institutions such as Harvard University. With tens of thousands of applicants vying for hundreds of admissions slots each year, these universities will likely no longer take race into account. Two cases against Harvard University and the University of North Carolina have sparked widespread controversy. These universities considered racial ratios in admissions, initially to boost the number of black and Hispanic students and ensure that minorities were fairly represented among students. However, Asian American students have filed lawsuits claiming that the admissions policies of these universities discriminate against Asians and undervalue their academic achievement and high grades. Asian groups have been divided over affirmative action. Supporters argue that the bill avoids discrimination against minorities and that Asian students are among the beneficiaries. However, opponents argue that the bill tends to favor the admission of other minorities when Asians are competing with them at the same time. Some younger generations of Asians argue that the bill nevertheless aims to ensure a diverse student body because Asian families generally focus on their children's grades at the expense of other areas of development.

	<div id="news4" class="w3-container w3-hide">
	  <p>
      Recently, the UK government has released a new International Education Strategy, indicating that it welcomes international students to the UK and commits to hosting at least 600,000 international students per year in the future. This initiative is good news for both international students and the UK education sector. In the new strategy, the UK government explains that the previous restrictions were designed to balance the benefits that international students bring to the UK with a commitment to controlling immigration. However, they added that the "PSW" visa application policy (graduate route visa) will remain unchanged, despite the ban on international students switching work visas before completing their studies. The strategy also mentions three priorities for international education: expanding education exports and supporting the diversification of income sources, protecting the competitiveness and sustainability of international enrolments, and developing UK global education. In addition, the UK government will invest significant resources to attract overseas teachers to fill vacancies. From September this year, hundreds of teachers are expected to come to work in the UK through the Overseas Recruitment Scheme. Some of the UK's top universities have already responded positively to this policy by announcing expansions. For example, University College London (UCL) will open a new campus with more student accommodation and academic facilities to accommodate more students. The University of Edinburgh will establish an interdisciplinary college designed to help students meet the challenges facing society in the future. The University of Bristol also plans to build a new campus to provide study and accommodation for more students. The University of St Andrews has announced that it will open a brand new business school to further enrich its subject areas. These initiatives will provide more choices and opportunities for students who are interested in studying in the UK. At the same time, the UK government's plan to expand international student recruitment is also expected to address the shortage of industry employees and enhance the quality of education and international reputation. Overall, the UK government's announcement to expand international student recruitment, which will host at least 600,000 international students per year, is good news for international students, the education sector and the UK's economic development.

	<div id="news4" class="w3-container w3-hide">
	  <p>
      Under a new legislative proposal drafted by Wisconsin lawmakers, students who score in the top 5 percent of their high school grade will be guaranteed admission to the University of Wisconsin or a public technical college of their choice. In addition, Homeschool students would likewise be guaranteed admission if they rank in the top 5 percent of students statewide in ACT scores. Although the proposal has not been formally introduced, State Senator Rachael Cabral-Guevara (D) is one of the expected sponsors of the bill and plans to introduce it sometime after the July break. Legislators recently held a press conference to discuss the proposal's contents. The proposal is designed to provide greater access and security for deserving students and ensure their access to Wisconsin's institutions of higher education. By giving admissions priority to students in the top 5 percent of high school grades, the legislation aims to encourage academic excellence and provide more options for students. For Homeschool students, the same admission opportunities are available to those who rank in the top 5% of students statewide on their ACT scores. This policy takes into account the realities of students from different educational backgrounds and provides them with a fair chance for admission. Although specific details of the bill have not yet been released, the proposal has attracted widespread attention and discussion. If passed, it would be an important reform in Wisconsin's higher education sector, providing more opportunities for talented students to enter college and promoting equity and diversity in education. As state senators plan to introduce the bill after the July break, the progress of this proposal and its impact on students will be closely watched. The implementation of this legislation will help shape Wisconsin's education system and pave the way for students' future development.	 </p

 <p>The Government of Canada recently announced a series of new policies designed to attract global business and highly skilled talent, promote economic growth and expand international exchange. These new policies include opening up work visas, expanding study opportunities and supporting entrepreneurial opportunities to provide more choice and opportunities for international talent. Under the new policies, Canada will relax restrictions on foreign workers and open up more work visa slots. This will provide more opportunities for international talent who wish to work in Canada, while meeting the demand for a highly skilled workforce for Canadian businesses. This move will help strengthen Canada's competitiveness in the global business and technology sector and promote innovation and economic development. In addition to opening up work visas, Canada is also expanding study opportunities and providing more educational options for international students. The new policy will further streamline the student visa application process and provide more scholarships and financial assistance programs to encourage more talented international students to choose Canada as their study destination. This initiative will not only promote international cultural exchange, but also inject new energy and diversity into Canada's education system. In addition, the Government of Canada is committed to supporting entrepreneurship and innovation. The new policy will provide more entrepreneurial opportunities and resources to support international talent who wish to start their own businesses. Entrepreneurs will benefit from a more flexible start-up visa policy and a business incubator program, which will help them realize their entrepreneurial dreams and thrive in Canada's thriving entrepreneurial ecosystem. Speaking at the launch of the new policies, Canada's Minister of Immigration said, "Through these new policies, we hope to attract the best business and highly skilled talent from around the world and strengthen Canada's capacity for innovation and economic development. We believe that opening up work visas, expanding learning opportunities and supporting entrepreneurship will lead to a mutually beneficial and win-win future for both Canadian and international talent." The implementation of this new set of policies will inject new energy and competitiveness into Canada, while providing international talent with more opportunities for growth and options for study and entrepreneurship. Canada will continue to embrace the spirit of openness, inclusiveness and innovation to build a brighter future with global talent.
