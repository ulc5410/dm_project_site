    <h4>High School Application</h4>
<p>
1. Detailed Steps for High School Application

- Take standardized tests.
- Prepare application materials, submit applications, and attend interviews (if required).
- Receive acceptance letters and apply for a U.S. visa.
</p>
<p>

- Gain rich extracurricular experiences.
</p>
<p>
1. Detailed Steps for High School Application
</p>
<p>
Understanding the differences between public and private high schools:
In the United States, high schools are divided into public and private schools. International students can apply to both types of schools, but international students can only attend public high schools for one year before transferring to a private high school. So, how do you choose between public and private high schools? Here are the characteristics of each:
</p>
<p>
Public High Schools:
- Vary in teaching quality, similar to public high schools in your home country.
- Relatively more relaxed management system, suitable for students with self-discipline and motivation.
</p>
<p>
Private High Schools:
- Provide more academic and college guidance through student advisors, with more resources invested compared to public schools.
- Higher tuition fees, and most students come from affluent families.
- Higher admission standards, with overall high-caliber student body.
- Emphasize personalized education and have smaller class sizes.
</p>
<p>
Whether you choose a public or private high school, students have the opportunity to apply to excellent universities. However, for international students who are new to studying in the United States, it takes some time to adapt to the environment. Therefore, parents should consider the learning environment that suits the student and decide whether to choose a public or private school.
</p>
<p>
Research application requirements and deadlines:
Before applying to high schools, it is crucial to understand the school's application requirements and deadlines. In addition to submitting student transcripts, high school applications require additional materials such as personal statements, parent statements, recommendation letters, English proficiency test scores (such as TOEFL or IELTS), standardized test scores (such as SSAT or ISEE), and financial documentation. Some highly selective private high schools may also require students to participate in video interviews.
This information can be found on the school's official website under the "Admission" or "How to apply" pages. The official website usually lists the requirements for international students, including language test score requirements and instructions for submitting official transcripts.
</p>
<p>
Take standardized tests:
Standardized test scores are one of the important factors in high school applications. It is generally recommended for students with strong humanities skills to take the SSAT exam, and for students with strong math skills to take the ISEE exam. International students also need to take the TOEFL exam. Different schools have different requirements for TOEFL scores, with some schools requiring scores around 80 for application, while others require scores above 100.
</p>
<p>
Prepare application materials, submit applications, and attend interviews (if required):
After understanding the application requirements and deadlines, parents should encourage their children to prepare application materials as soon as possible, especially the personal statement. While student grades and standardized test scores can demonstrate academic abilities, the personal statement is essential as it showcases the student's leadership abilities, passion, and problem-solving skills.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, students will need to coordinate with school staff and teachers for past transcripts and teacher recommendation letters. To avoid missing application deadlines, parents should encourage their children to discuss the writing of recommendation letters with teachers as early as possible and consult school staff on how to provide official transcripts. All Chinese documents should be translated into English.
</p>
<p>
Parent statements and financial documentation are parts that parents need to complete. As parents know their children best, some high schools may require parents to provide a parent statement, introducing the child's strengths, personal qualities, and interests. Financial documentation is required for all international students to demonstrate the parents' ability to pay for tuition and living expenses.
</p>
<p>
Receive acceptance letters and apply for a U.S. visa:
Once you receive the acceptance letter and I-20 form from the school, parents can help their children apply for a visa and schedule an interview. During the interview, the visa officer may ask some simple questions, and students should answer truthfully and confidently.
</p>
<p>
Benefits of High School Experience for College Applications
</p>
<p>
Eliminate language and cultural barriers:
For international students, English is not their native language, and they may feel uncomfortable communicating. Through the experience of studying in a U.S. high school, students can gradually eliminate language and cultural barriers.
</p>
<p>
Rich extracurricular experiences:
U.S. high schools offer a wide range of extracurricular activities such as clubs, organizations, and volunteer work. Participating in these activities can demonstrate a student's well-rounded development and leadership skills, adding competitiveness to college applications.
</p>
<p>
In conclusion, applying to a U.S. high school holds significant importance for international students. By understanding the application steps, researching requirements, taking standardized tests, preparing application materials, and receiving acceptance letters, international students can lay a solid foundation for future college applications. The high school experience not only helps eliminate language and cultural barriers but also provides ample opportunities for rich extracurricular experiences, offering more chances for college applications.
