I"b<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>Whether you’re using Markdown or HTML, Jekyll makes it easy for you to insert beautiful code blocks into your pages.</p>

<p>By default, Jekyll comes with pygments.rb, which is a syntax highlighter based on Python. To use it on Windows, you’ll need to install Python and some extra tools.</p>

<p>A nice alternative is the Ruby-based Rouge, which is faster and easier to install, but doesn’t support as many languages as Pygments.</p>

<p>Below, you’ll find instructions for both syntax highlighters. Choose the one that best suits your needs. More information can be found on <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/docs/templates/#code-snippet-highlighting">the official Jekyll website</a>.</p>

<h2 id="install-rouge">Install Rouge</h2>

<p>Quick and painless: Open your favorite command line tool and enter the following command.</p>

<pre><code>gem install rouge
</code></pre>

<p>Then, in your <code>_config.yml</code>, set Rouge as your syntax highlighter:</p>

<pre><code>highlighter: rouge
</code></pre>

<p>Done!</p>

<h2 id="make-pygments-work">Make Pygments work</h2>

<p>If you want to use Pygments, which is a default Jekyll dependency, for syntax highlighting on Windows, you need to install Python, pip and finally the Python base of pygments.rb.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> After you complete the following steps, Jekyll might still output errors when building or serving sites. These shouldn’t cause any real problems though, so you can safely ignore them.</p>

<h3 id="install-python">Install Python</h3>

<p>The latest working version of Python at the time of writing is v2.7.8. Python 3 will not work.</p>

<p>Click the button below and download the v2.7 installer that matches your system’s architecture (32bits / 64bits).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.python.org/download/" class="button-external" target="_blank">Get Python</a></p>

<p>Execute the downloaded file and go through the steps of the installation.</p>

<p>When you get to the screen below, make sure to click on the box next to <em>Add python.exe to Path</em> and select “Entire feature will be installed on local hard drive.”</p>

<h3 id="install-pip">Install pip</h3>

<p>Pip is a tool for installing and managing Python packages, similar to Ruby Gems. You’ll need it to install Pygments, the Python package that pygments.rb uses to highlight your code.</p>

<p>First, click on the button below and download <code>get-pip.py</code> via the link on that site.</p>

<p><a href="https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing.html" class="button-external" target="_blank">Get pip</a></p>

<p>Next, open your favorite command line tool and navigate to the location of <code>get-pip.py</code> on your computer (e.g., <code>C:\pip\</code> or whatever folder you saved it into).</p>

<pre><code>cd C:\pip
</code></pre>

<p>Then, run the following command to automagically download and install all required components.</p>

<pre><code>python get-pip.py
</code></pre>

<h3 id="install-python-base-of-pygments">Install Python base of Pygments</h3>

<p>From the command line, run the following command to install the Python base of Pygments.</p>

<pre><code>python -m pip install Pygments
</code></pre>

<h3 id="set-pygments-as-your-syntax-highlighter">Set Pygments as your syntax highlighter</h3>

<p>If it’s not set already, add the following to your <code>_config.yml</code> to set Pygments as your syntax highlighter.</p>

<pre><code>highlighter: pygments
</code></pre>
